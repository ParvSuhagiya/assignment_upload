    <h3>What happens if Pakistan pull out of UAE match</h3>

    <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) threatened to withdraw from the Asia Cup 2025 Group A match against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) if the ICC doesn't remove match referee Andy Pycroft for the remainder of the eight-team tournament. The aftermath of the no-handshake saga in the match between India and Pakistan has seen the PCB put its foot down and make some bold statements. The conclusion of the match between India and Pakistan saw Suryakumar Yadav and his team refusing to shake hands and shutting the door on their opponents as the customary exchange of greetings was denied.Pakistan captain Salman Agha and coach Mike Hesson were left fuming with this snub. The right-handed batter Agha even snubbed the post-match presentation, refusing to interact with former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar.</p>


    <h3>Surya, the leader, stands up tall</h3>

    <p>It’s too early to talk about Suryakumar’s legacy in Indian cricket. He is not a scorer in the conventional mould. Yet his batting has been highly spoken of, purely because of the audacity with which he has been targeting the most obscure corners with the most unorthodox shots.A team man to the core. Sharp fielder too; remember the catch at Bridgetown in 2024? But probably now it will dawn upon us how he is also this immense leader who can be unmoved by the chaos around him as long as he knows when, where and how to deliver a message for the country without worrying about being judged. As he said later: “I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsman spirit.”
    It’s impossible to understand what must have been going through Suryakumar’s mind in the build-up to the toss, how the quietly keyed-up anticipation must have made the decision-making process more arduous than it usually is.Impressively mature, however, was Suryakumar’s approach of staying on till the very end. Before this match, his T20 scores against Pakistan were 11, 18, 13, 5 and 7. Sunday’s unbeaten 47 thus, had an unshackling effect. “It’s a great feeling and it’s a perfect return gift for India,” Suryakumar said. “This is one box I always wanted to tick, stay there till the end, and it was the need of the hour today. And I loved to stay not out till the end.”</p>

    <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on Monday, broke the silence as the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is reportedly mulling disciplinary action against the Indian team after their non-handshake stance in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A match against Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium. ACC, however, has yet to make an official statement on the incident.

According to a report in CricketPakistan.com, the controversy drew the attention of the ACC, which is "weighing possible disciplinary action against the Indian team." The report also added that the final decision will be taken after reviewing all related clips pertaining to the incident, with fines on Indian players being a likely outcome.

Amid the wait for an official statement from the ACC, a senior BCCI official told PTI on condition of anonymity that since the rule book makes no mention of handshakes, the customary gesture is a matter of goodwill, not law. This clearly means that India cannot be compelled to extend it to Pakistan, given the strained relations.

"Look, if you read the rule book, there is no specification about shaking hands with the opposition. It is a goodwill gesture and a sort of convention not law that is followed globally across the sporting spectrum," a senior BCCI official said.

"If there is no law, then the Indian cricket team is not bound to shake hands with an opposition with whom there is a history of strained relationship," he added.</p>
