    <p>Actor Akshay Kumar and former actor-writer Twinkle Khanna’s son Aarav turned 23 on 15 September. Celebrating his birthday, his parents penned down the sweetest and witty birthday wishes for him on Instagram, complete with Akshay calling himself a ‘sidekick’ and Twinkle comparing him to ‘air’. Take a look.Akshay posted a selfie he took with Aarav, writing how, at his age, he was learning how to beat people up on screen. He wrote, “Happy 23rd, Aarav! When I was twenty three I was learning to beat up people on screen… it’s a strange feeling now to see you beat me everyday right from tech to fashion to arguments on the dinner table.”Twinkle also shared the same picture on her Instagram, remarking how she still wants to hold on to him, writing, “And he turns 23. Though I have an undeniable compulsion to hold on to him, it would be wise to remember that children are like the air stored in our lungs, in our custody for just a moment before the next exhalation. This may not be an entirely correct analogy because unlike breaths we can’t keep popping babies in and out constantly, but you get the point right :) Here’s to the birthday boy. May he continue filling the world with his inate kindness.”</p>

    <p>Mirai collected ₹13 crore on its opening day in India, and the numbers only grew through the weekend. Given the weekday, the dip in collections that Mirai shows is expected. However, it remains to be seen if it continues to sustain the momentum throughout the week.

Mirai made ₹15 crore and ₹17 crore during the weekend, making ₹45 crore in three days in India. According to the producers, People Media Factory, the film collected ₹81.2 crore worldwide in its first weekend and is expected to cross the ₹100 crore mark soon.

About Mirai
Expectations were high on Mirai, given that it’s Teja’s first film since the 2024 hit HanuMan, directed by Prasanth Varma. HanuMan was released for Sankranthi in competition with Mahesh Babu’s Guntur Kaaram, Venkatesh’s Saindhav and Nagarjuna’s Naa Saami Ranga. It emerged on top and collected ₹295 crore worldwide.

Mirai tells the story of a young man named Vedha (Teja) who finds out from a sanyasini named Vibha (Ritika) that he is destined for more in life. A prophecy comes true, sees him face off against Mahabir Lama, aka the Black Sword (Manchu Manoj), a powerful sorcerer, and protect the nine gradhas (text) left behind by Emperor Ashoka from falling into his hands. To face him off, he seeks out a weapon used by Lord Rama called the Mirai.</p>
